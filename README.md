# Password-Generator
Hello I've made a password generator for users to generate secured passwords upon clicking the button. It can use 8-128 characters, anything not in that character length, user will be prompted to correct length before proceeding. The generator specifies if the user would like to use special characters, uppercase characters, and lowercase letters, adds that to array of password keys that can be generated. The function then randomizes the values we are able to use and generates a random array with those values.
