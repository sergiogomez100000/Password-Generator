# Password-Generator

# Goals
To make a password generator that generates secure passwords according to the users preference. Using the user's input, I want them to specify how many characters they want the password to be, whether they want special characters, numbers, upper or lower case characters in there password. Then, using that information we will generate a random password and be able to save it to the user's clipboard.

# Description
Hello I've made a password generator for users to generate secured passwords upon clicking the button. You will be allowed to customize the password that will be generated. The generator specifies how many characters are desired in the password(between 8 and 128), if the user would like to use special characters, numbers, uppercase characters, and lowercase letters, and adds that to possible passwords that can be generated. The values are randomized and we are able to generate a random password with those values. you can also save the password to your clipboard using the "Copy to Clipboard" button. 

# Usage
Users can use my application to create passwords safely. they generate a more secure password by using between 8-128 characters and utilizing special characters, numbers, upper and lower case letters as well. the password will always be randomized.
