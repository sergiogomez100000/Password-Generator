# Password-Generator

# Goals
To make a password generator that generates secure passwords according to the users preference. using prompts I want to specify to the user how many characters they want the password to be, whether they want special characters, numbers, upper or lower case characters in there password. Then, using that information we will generate a random password.

# Description
Hello I've made a password generator for users to generate secured passwords upon clicking the button. You will be prompted to customize the password that will be generated. It can use 8-128 characters, anything not in that character length, user will be prompted to correct length before proceeding. The generator specifies if the user would like to use special characters, uppercase characters, and lowercase letters, adds that to array of password keys that can be generated. The function then randomizes the values we are able to use and generates a random array with those values. 

# Usage
Users can use my application to create password safely. they generate a more secure password by using between 8-128 characters and utilizing special characters, numbers, upper and lower case letters as well. the password will always be randomized.
